Bootstrap compiler for nucleus, implemented in Common Lisp.

A lot of the code is super messy, there isn't much error checking, and the
error messages when something does go wrong are usually terrible. This is
because this is a temporary system only intended to work as much as is
necessary to support the proper, self-hosting compiler.
